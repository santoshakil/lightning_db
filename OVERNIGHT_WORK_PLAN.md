## Git Strategy:
- Commit after each completed section
- Push every 2-3 commits
- Create feature branches for major changes
- Use conventional commits
- Tag stable points

## Commands to Run Periodically:
```bash
# Check compilation
cargo check --all-targets --all-features

# Run tests
cargo test --all-features

# Check CI locally
./scripts/validate-ci.sh

# Build all platforms
./scripts/build-all-platforms.sh
```

## Progress Tracking:
- [ ] Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] Phase 2 Complete
- [ ] Phase 3 Complete
- [ ] Phase 4 Complete
- [ ] Phase 5 Complete
- [ ] Phase 6 Complete

## Notes:
- Focus on getting CI green first
- Test each change locally before committing
- Document any issues encountered
- Create issues for items that need follow-up
- Take breaks every 2 hours to maintain quality
