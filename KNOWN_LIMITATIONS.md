# Known Limitations and Future Work

This document outlines known limitations and TODO items in the Lightning DB codebase.

## Production-Ready Core Features âœ…

The following core features are production-ready and fully implemented:
- Synchronous Database API
- B+Tree storage engine
- LSM tree with compaction
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) with crash recovery
- MVCC transactions
- FFI bindings (C API and Dart/Flutter)
- Memory management and caching
- Compression support
- Data integrity verification (with limitations noted below)

## Known Limitations

### 1. Integrity Verification Statistics
**Location**: `src/integrity.rs:145`
**Status**: Functional with placeholder values
**Impact**: Low - verification works but reports placeholder page statistics
**Description**: The integrity verification system works correctly but uses placeholder values for page manager statistics. The verification process itself is comprehensive and detects actual integrity issues.

### 2. Value Encryption (Future Feature)
**Location**: `src/serialization/value_encoder.rs:104-109`
**Status**: Placeholder implementation
**Impact**: None - feature not enabled by default
**Description**: Encryption/decryption interfaces exist but are not implemented. This is designed for future security features and does not affect current functionality.

### 3. Async API Layer (Experimental)
**Location**: `src/async_*.rs` modules
**Status**: Experimental/incomplete
**Impact**: None - not used by core database or FFI
**Description**: Async API layers are experimental additions that do not affect the core synchronous database functionality or FFI bindings.

### 4. Basic WAL LSN Recovery
**Location**: `src/wal/mod.rs:148`
**Status**: Superseded by improved implementation
**Impact**: None - improved WAL handles recovery correctly
**Description**: The basic WAL implementation has a TODO for LSN recovery, but this is superseded by the ImprovedWriteAheadLog which properly handles crash recovery and LSN management.

## Performance Optimizations (Future Work)

The following TODOs are performance optimizations that do not affect correctness:
- Lock-free cache improvements (`src/lock_free/cache.rs`)
- Additional SSTable iterators (`src/lsm/iterator.rs`)
- Memory-only mode optimizations (`examples/test_ultimate_perf.rs`)

## Testing Improvements (Future Work)

The following TODOs are testing improvements:
- Additional test coverage for edge cases
- Performance regression tests
- Extended stress testing scenarios

## Conclusion

Lightning DB is production-ready for its core use cases. The known limitations are either:
1. Future features not yet implemented (encryption, async API)
2. Placeholder implementations that don't affect functionality (integrity statistics)
3. Legacy code superseded by better implementations (basic WAL)

All critical functionality for a production database is implemented and tested.
