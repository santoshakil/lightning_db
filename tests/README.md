### Using the Test Runner Script

The included script provides comprehensive testing options:

```bash
# Basic memory safety tests
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh basic

# Comprehensive validation (all tests)
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh comprehensive

# Stress testing
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh stress -i 100000 -t 16

# Focused testing for specific components
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh focused --pattern io_uring
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh focused --pattern memory_layout
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh focused --pattern lock_free

# Generate detailed report
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh comprehensive --report
```

### Sanitizer Testing

To run tests with sanitizers (requires nightly Rust):

```bash
# AddressSanitizer
RUSTFLAGS="-Zsanitizer=address" cargo +nightly test --features asan

# ThreadSanitizer  
RUSTFLAGS="-Zsanitizer=thread" cargo +nightly test --features tsan

# All sanitizers via script
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh sanitizers --all-sanitizers
```

### MIRI Testing

For enhanced validation with MIRI:

```bash
cargo +nightly miri test memory_safety
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `TEST_ITERATIONS` - Number of test iterations (default: 10000)
- `TEST_THREADS` - Number of concurrent threads (default: 8)
- `STRESS_DURATION_MS` - Stress test duration (default: 1000ms)
- `EXTENDED_TESTS` - Enable extended/stress tests (default: false)
- `CI` - Enable CI-specific configurations (default: false)

### Sanitizer Options

Sanitizers can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# AddressSanitizer
export ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=1:detect_stack_use_after_return=1:abort_on_error=0"

# ThreadSanitizer
export TSAN_OPTIONS="detect_deadlocks=1:detect_atomic_races=1:halt_on_error=0"

# MemorySanitizer
export MSAN_OPTIONS="poison_heap=1:track_origins=1:print_stats=1"
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Buffer Overflow Detection
- Tests boundary checks in unsafe buffer operations
- Validates AlignedBuffer operations in io_uring
- Verifies SIMD operations don't exceed buffer bounds
- Checks memory-mapped I/O boundaries
- Ensures zero-copy operations stay within allocated memory

### 2. Use-After-Free Detection
- Tests that freed memory is not accessed
- Validates proper cleanup in Drop implementations
- Tests lock-free structure memory reclamation

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Memory Safety Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  memory-safety:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test-type: [basic, unsafe, comprehensive]
        
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Install Rust nightly
      uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      with:
        toolchain: nightly
        components: miri
        
    - name: Install sanitizers
      run: rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
      
    - name: Run memory safety tests
      run: |
        ./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh ${{ matrix.test-type }} --ci
        
    - name: Run MIRI tests
      run: |
        ./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh miri
```

### Local Development

For local development, create a git pre-commit hook:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "Running memory safety validation..."
./scripts/run_memory_safety_tests.sh basic

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Memory safety tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sanitizer build failures**
   - Ensure you're using nightly Rust: `rustup install nightly`
   - Some sanitizers are platform-specific (MSAN is Linux-only)

2. **MIRI timeout issues**
   - MIRI is significantly slower, increase timeout values
   - Use MIRI-compatible test configurations

3. **False positives in sanitizers**
   - Review sanitizer options and adjust detection levels
   - Some external libraries may trigger false positives

4. **Test flakiness**
   - Concurrent tests may be timing-dependent
   - Adjust thread counts and iteration counts for stability

### Performance Considerations

- Basic tests: ~5-30 seconds
- Unsafe validation: ~1-5 minutes  
- Sanitizer tests: ~5-15 minutes
- Comprehensive tests: ~10-30 minutes
- MIRI tests: ~30-120 minutes

## Contributing

When adding new unsafe blocks:

1. Add corresponding validation tests in the appropriate module
2. Update the unsafe block count in documentation
3. Add focused test cases for the new unsafe pattern
4. Ensure tests pass with all sanitizers
5. Update this README if new test categories are added

## Security

These tests are designed to catch memory safety violations that could lead to:
- Buffer overflows and underflows
- Use-after-free vulnerabilities
- Data races and undefined behavior
- Memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Type confusion attacks
- Alignment-related crashes

Regular execution of these tests helps maintain the security guarantees of Lightning DB's performance-critical unsafe code.
