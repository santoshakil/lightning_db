# Lightning DB OLTP Performance Baseline

**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Environment:** Development (macOS, local filesystem)

## Current Status

Based on the codebase analysis and existing reports:

### Architecture Components
- **Storage Engine:** B+Tree (row-based) + LSM Tree (write-optimized)
- **Transaction Manager:** MVCC with optimistic concurrency control
- **Cache:** Unified cache with LRU eviction, adaptive sizing
- **WAL:** Write-ahead logging with group commit optimization
- **Concurrency:** Lock-free data structures for hot paths

### Reported Performance (from ENTERPRISE_GRADE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)
- **B+Tree Performance:**
  - Reads: 14.4M ops/sec
  - Range scans: 8.2M ops/sec
  - Memory footprint: <100MB for 1M keys

- **LSM Tree Performance:**
  - Writes: 850K ops/sec
  - Compaction: <100ms for 10MB segments
  - Read amplification: 1.5x average

- **Transaction System:**
  - Commit latency: <1ms (p99)
  - Rollback: <500μs
  - Deadlock detection: <50ms

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Lock Contention:**
   - Global write lock on B+Tree operations
   - Transaction manager lock during commit
   - Page manager allocation lock

2. **Memory Management:**
   - No memory pooling for small allocations
   - Page cache not pre-warmed
   - Excessive allocations in hot paths

3. **I/O Patterns:**
   - No read-ahead optimization
   - Sequential scans not optimized
   - WAL not using direct I/O

## Optimization Targets

### Phase 3.2: Lock Contention Reduction
**Target:** Reduce lock contention by 50%

**Planned Optimizations:**
1. Implement optimistic latching for B+Tree nodes
2. Use epoch-based reclamation for lock-free reads
3. Partition transaction manager locks
4. Implement NUMA-aware memory allocation

### Phase 3.3: B+Tree Performance
**Target:** Improve throughput by 30%

**Planned Optimizations:**
1. Implement prefix compression for keys
2. Add adaptive node sizes (16KB for leaf, 4KB for internal)
3. Implement bulk loading for initial data
4. Add SIMD-based key comparisons
5. Optimize node split/merge algorithms

## Benchmark Plan

### Workload Profiles

1. **OLTP-Write Heavy (TPC-C like)**
   - 45% inserts
   - 35% updates
   - 20% reads
   - Transaction size: 5-10 operations

2. **OLTP-Read Heavy (TPC-B like)**
   - 10% inserts
   - 10% updates
   - 80% reads
   - Transaction size: 3-5 operations

3. **OLTP-Mixed (YCSB-F)**
   - 25% inserts
   - 25% updates
   - 25% reads
   - 25% read-modify-write
   - Transaction size: 1-3 operations

### Measurement Metrics

**Latency Metrics:**
- p50, p95, p99, p99.9 latencies
- Breakdown by operation type
- Transaction commit latency

**Throughput Metrics:**
- Operations per second
- Transactions per second
- MB/sec for bulk operations

**Resource Metrics:**
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- I/O operations per second
- Lock wait time
- Cache hit rate

### Test Data Characteristics

- **Key Size:** 8-64 bytes (variable)
- **Value Size:** 100-1000 bytes (variable)
- **Dataset Size:** 10GB (fits in memory)
- **Working Set:** 20% of dataset (hot data)
- **Access Pattern:** Zipfian distribution (80/20 rule)

## Expected Baseline (Current)

Based on code analysis and similar systems:

| Metric | Expected Value | Target After Optimization |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Single-threaded TPS | 50K-100K | 150K-200K |
| Multi-threaded TPS (8 cores) | 200K-400K | 600K-800K |
| Read latency (p50) | 5-10 μs | 2-5 μs |
| Read latency (p99) | 50-100 μs | 20-50 μs |
| Write latency (p50) | 20-50 μs | 10-20 μs |
| Write latency (p99) | 200-500 μs | 100-200 μs |
| Memory per 1M keys | 100-150 MB | 80-100 MB |
| WAL throughput | 100-200 MB/s | 300-500 MB/s |

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Compilation fixes
- ✅ Dead code removal
- ✅ Security audit

### In Progress
- 🔄 OLTP benchmark creation
- 🔄 Performance baseline measurement

### Pending
- ⏳ Lock contention optimization
- ⏳ B+Tree performance improvements
- ⏳ Memory management optimization

- ⏳ Benchmark automation

## Risk Factors

1. **Compilation Issues:** Some test files still have errors
2. **API Stability:** Database API may need adjustments
3. **Platform Dependencies:** io_uring only on Linux
4. **Test Coverage:** Limited integration tests for transactions

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining compilation issues in tests
2. Create minimal OLTP benchmark
3. Measure actual baseline performance
4. Identify top bottlenecks with profiling
5. Implement targeted optimizations
6. Re-measure and validate improvements

## Notes

- Current implementation shows good architectural foundations
- Security hardening completed successfully
- Main performance bottlenecks are in locking and memory allocation
- Columnar features exist but need validation for OLAP workloads
