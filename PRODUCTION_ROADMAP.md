## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDER

**This is a DATABASE** - Every decision must prioritize:
1. **Data Integrity** - Never lose or corrupt data
2. **Reliability** - Consistent behavior under all conditions
3. **Durability** - Survive crashes and recover fully
4. **Performance** - Meet SLAs consistently
5. **Operability** - Easy to monitor and troubleshoot

**Think deeply about every change. Test exhaustively. Document thoroughly.**
