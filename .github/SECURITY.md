Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to security@company.com
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/username/lightning_db/security/advisories/new) feature
3. **Security Contact**: Direct message to project maintainers

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Vulnerability Type**: What kind of vulnerability is it? (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow, etc.)
- **Location**: Where is the vulnerability located? (e.g., file name, line number, function name)
- **Impact**: What is the potential impact of this vulnerability?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, provide a minimal proof-of-concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue, please include them

### Response Timeline

We strive to respond to security reports in a timely manner:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after initial report or after fix is released

### Security Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Development**: We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability
4. **Coordination**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
5. **Release**: We will release the security fix and publish a security advisory
6. **Recognition**: We will acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Measures

Lightning DB implements multiple layers of security controls:

### Code Security
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with multiple tools
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with cargo-audit
- Secret detection and prevention
- Security-focused linting rules
- Regular security code reviews

### Build Security
- Supply chain security checks
- Container security scanning
- License compliance verification
- Reproducible builds
- Signed releases

### Runtime Security
- Memory safety through Rust
- Minimal attack surface
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without information disclosure
- Resource limits and rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- Automated security monitoring
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures
- Access controls and audit logging

## Security Advisories

Security advisories for Lightning DB are published through:

- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/username/lightning_db/security/advisories)
- [CVE Database](https://cve.mitre.org/) (for applicable vulnerabilities)
- Project mailing list and announcements

## Security Best Practices

When using Lightning DB in your applications, we recommend:

### Development
- Always use the latest stable version
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Enable all available security features
- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement proper error handling

### Deployment
- Use least privilege access controls
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor for security events
- Implement network security controls
- Regular security assessments

### Configuration
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Configure appropriate timeouts and limits
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Regular security hardening reviews

## Security Tools

We use and recommend the following security tools:

### Scanning Tools
- **cargo-audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **cargo-deny**: License and supply chain security
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security testing
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning

### Monitoring Tools
- **GitHub Security**: Automated security monitoring
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Security Scorecard**: Security posture assessment

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This means:

- **Coordinated**: We work together on timeline and disclosure
- **Reasonable**: We provide reasonable time to develop and test fixes
- **Transparent**: We communicate openly about the process
- **Recognition**: We acknowledge security researchers appropriately

### Bug Bounty

Currently, Lightning DB does not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture and will recognize valuable contributions.
