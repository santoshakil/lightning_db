   - 10 files with explicit panic!() calls
   - Inconsistent error propagation

2. **Unsafe Code**
   - 14 files contain unsafe blocks
   - SIMD operations lack comprehensive bounds checking
   - Memory-mapped I/O error handling needs improvement

3. **Performance Issues**
   - 131+ files use .clone() excessively
   - Lock contention in page manager
   - No backpressure mechanism in LSM compaction

### Testing Coverage

**Strengths:**
- 151 unit tests (mostly passing)
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Chaos engineering suite
- Performance benchmarks

**Gaps:**
- No fuzz testing

## Conclusion

Lightning DB demonstrates exceptional performance potential and innovative architecture. The hybrid B+Tree/LSM design, combined with modern optimizations and Rust's safety guarantees, positions it well for high-performance embedded database needs.

However, several critical issues must be resolved before production deployment:
1. Memory leak causing 63.84 MB growth per 30 seconds
2. Chaos test failures indicating stability issues
3. Data integrity bypass vulnerability
4. Pervasive use of unwrap() creating panic risks

With focused effort on these issues, Lightning DB could become a leading solution for:
- Edge computing and IoT applications
- High-frequency trading systems
- Real-time analytics pipelines
- Safety-critical embedded systems

The project's success will depend on maintaining its performance advantages while improving stability, completing partial implementations, and building a robust ecosystem.

### Next Steps
