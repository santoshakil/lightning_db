# Changelog

All notable changes to Lightning DB will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive real-world test suite covering:
  - E-commerce scenarios with transactions
  - Time series data handling
  - Concurrent operations stress testing
  - Crash recovery simulation
  - Large value handling
  - Batch operations performance
- Quick performance test utility for benchmarking
- Database module split into logical submodules (operations, transactions, indexing, maintenance, metrics, lifecycle)

### Changed
- Optimized transaction logging from info to debug level for 15x performance improvement
- Updated performance benchmarks in documentation:
  - Sequential writes: 296K+ ops/sec
  - Cached reads: 255K+ ops/sec
  - Batch operations: 2.3M+ ops/sec
  - Transactions: 71K+ ops/sec
- Refactored Database implementation into separate modules for better maintainability
- Consolidated test files - merged real_world_validation.rs into real_world_scenarios.rs

### Fixed
- Critical unreachable!() panic in get_cache_stats method
- B-tree node splits test with incorrect reverse insertion logic
- Duplicate dependencies in Cargo.toml (hex, flate2, subtle)
- Compilation errors from modularization
- All import warnings and unused code warnings
- BTreeWriteBuffer method names (insert/remove instead of put/delete)
- CacheStats visibility for external use
- ConsistencyManager API usage

### Removed
- Test module from lib.rs (315 lines) - tests now properly separated
- .DS_Store files from repository
- Dead code and commented-out implementations
- Outdated documentation files (API_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md, CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md, IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md, test_optimizations.md)
- Duplicate backup/restore implementations
- Excessive logging from hot paths (put, get, delete operations)
- 2934-line monolithic Database impl block
- Duplicate test file real_world_validation.rs
