//! DISABLED DUE TO CRITICAL MEMORY SAFETY ISSUES
//!
//! This lock-free B+Tree implementation contains severe memory safety bugs:
//! - Unsafe pointer dereferencing without proper validation
//! - Race conditions in concurrent node updates  
//! - Potential use-after-free in epoch reclamation
//! - Missing memory barriers causing data races
//! - ABA problems in lock-free operations
//!
//! DO NOT ENABLE WITHOUT COMPLETE REDESIGN AND FORMAL VERIFICATION
//! Use LockFreeBTreeWrapper instead which provides safe concurrency.

/*
ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION COMMENTED OUT FOR SAFETY

The original implementation had the following critical issues:

1. UNSAFE POINTER DEREFERENCING (Lines 178, 412, 443, etc.):
   - Raw pointer conversion: unsafe { current.as_ref() }
   - No validation that pointer is still valid
   - Race condition: pointer could be freed between check and use

2. RACE CONDITIONS IN NODE UPDATES (Lines 477-504):
   - Multiple threads modifying same node simultaneously
   - Version increment not atomic with actual modifications
   - Window between version check and actual update

3. USE-AFTER-FREE POTENTIAL (Lines 549-598):
   - Nodes converted to Shared pointers without proper epoch protection
   - Split operations can free nodes while other threads access them
   - Memory reclamation not synchronized with all readers

4. MISSING MEMORY BARRIERS (Lines 183-243):
   - Atomic loads/stores without proper ordering
   - Data races in concurrent read/write scenarios
   - Memory visibility issues across threads

5. UNION ACCESS WITHOUT SYNCHRONIZATION (Lines 221-222, 486-487):
   - NodeValues union accessed without ensuring correct variant
   - No atomic operations on union fields
   - Data corruption possible with concurrent access

6. ABA PROBLEMS IN LOCK-FREE OPERATIONS:
   - Pointer values can be reused after deallocation
   - Compare-and-swap operations can succeed incorrectly
   - No protection against memory reuse patterns

The test at line 947 was already marked #[ignore] acknowledging these issues.
