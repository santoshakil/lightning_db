## Deployment Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Start with recommended configuration**
   ```rust
   LightningDbConfig {
       cache_size: available_memory * 0.5,
       compression_type: CompressionType::Zstd,
       wal_sync_mode: WalSyncMode::Sync,
       max_active_transactions: 1000,
       ..Default::default()
   }
   ```

2. **Enable monitoring from day one**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert on key metrics

3. **Implement proper backup strategy**
   - Daily full backups
   - Continuous incremental backups
   - Test restore procedures

4. **Plan for growth**
   - Monitor disk usage trends
   - Scale before 80% capacity
   - Have migration plan ready
