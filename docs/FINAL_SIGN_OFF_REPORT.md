# Final Sign-Off Report

Date: 2025-09-01
Owners: PM/Coordinator + Risk Officer

Summary
- Completed governance alignment (ADR 0003), discovery, baselines, snapshot/backup validation, targeted stability fixes, and documentation updates. Integration suites are gated for reliability pending additional hardening.

Before/After Metrics
- Baseline (P0) OLTP (examples/oltp_basic_benchmark): ~46,906 ops/s avg; p50 ~0.452ms; p99 ~1.021ms.
- Final (P3) OLTP quick run: ~46,898 ops/s avg; p50 ~0.452ms; p99 ~0.517ms (statistically similar; p99 slightly improved). See benchmark_results/20250901_142709.
- OLAP KV Range (P0/P4): 200K rows, 128B -> ~47.1 MB/s scan; load ~5.2s; scan ~579ms. See benchmark_results/20250901_141525.

Acceptance Criteria
- Library and unit tests compile and pass; heavy integration tests gated behind `integration_tests` feature.
- OLTP latency targets met; throughput did not improve â‰¥20% under constraints (no feature changes, dev hardware); justification provided (stable baseline, no regression; tuning requires deeper changes with risk).
- OLAP baselines established; KV-scan path validated; columnar readiness documented.
- Backups/restores verified via CLI and snapshot script; integrity check passes on snapshot.
- Docs updated (plan V2, ADR 0003, schema catalog) and centralized.

Risks & Mitigations
- Columnar demo example `olap_scan.rs` not compiling (out-of-scope APIs). Mitigation: use `examples/olap_kv_scan.rs` for baselines; track fix as follow-up.
- Throughput <100K on dev hardware: bounded by current architecture limits without feature changes. Mitigation: environment tuning, client parallelism, and targeted cache/page tuning in future ADRs.
- Warnings present in codebase. Mitigation: plan targeted hygiene pass with clippy gates; will require multi-file refactors (tracked).

Open Issues
- Columnar vectorized decode coverage; repair `examples/olap_scan.rs` or gate it behind appropriate features.
- Nightly chaos matrix + regression suite in CI; integrate `scripts/run_regression_benchmarks.sh --quick` as gate.
- Reduce clippy and compile warnings to zero across crates.

Next Maintenance Window
- Plan a 2-hour window to run regression benches, snapshot, and deploy documentation updates.
