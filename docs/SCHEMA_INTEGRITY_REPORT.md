# Schema & Stability Audit Report

Date: 2025-09-01
Owner: Schema Auditor + Risk Officer

Scope
- Audit of migrations, indices/constraints, WAL/recovery, and data quality.

Findings
- Migrations: Engine present; idempotency validated on fresh runs (no external DB deps). Back/forward simulated on temp datasets; re-runs no-op. Fixed CLI `run_cli` to return errors instead of exiting, ensuring proper error propagation in binaries.
- Constraints: Primary/unique enforced at engine-level invariants in B+Tree and index manager; FK semantics not modeled (out of scope).
- WAL/Recovery: Unified WAL paths default; Sync/Async/Periodic modes documented. Crash-recovery tested in unit/integration harness; 100+ randomized write/flush sequences recommended in CI nightly.
- Data Quality: No orphan index entries detected during synthetic runs; checksum hooks available; version cleanup thread enabled by default.

Actions
- Fixed migration CLI to avoid `process::exit` in library layer; errors now returned to caller binary for controlled exit (no external behavior change).
- Added snapshot+backup artifacts for baseline: `snapshots/<date>/` created; full backup tested with no compression (Zstd not enabled in this build).
- Validated OLTP and OLAP quick baselines; artifacts under `benchmark_results/<date>/`.

Evidence
- Snapshots: `snapshots/<date>/`
- Tests:
  - Default fast path: `cargo test --lib --tests` green.
  - Heavy integration suites gated behind `integration_tests` (run explicitly when required).
- WAL config validated in tests/production_integration_tests.rs.

Rollback
- Snapshots enable restore; backup CLI pathway validated in runbooks.
