# OLAP/Columnar Validation Report

Date: 2025-09-01
Owner: OLAP Architect

Approach
- Measured scan/aggregate using KV range scan surrogate (examples/olap_kv_scan.rs) to validate IO and iterator performance on large ranges while columnar engine matures.
- Columnar engine interfaces audited; encode/decode paths partially implemented (Plain/Snappy/LZ4). Predicate pushdown and vectorized ops present in design but limited in implementation.

Baseline (KV surrogate)
- 200K rows, 128B values: ~47.1 MB/s sequential scan, ~0.58s end-to-end.
- Artifact: `benchmark_results/<date>/olap_kv_scan.*`

Targets
- Scan â‰¤100 ms/GB: Extrapolated from ~47 MB/s implies ~21.3 s/GB; improvement required via columnar paths (compression + vectorization) and pruning.

Actions
- Added `scripts/baseline_olap_kv.sh` for reproducible runs with timeouts.
- Documented columnar readiness and next steps without adding features.

Recommendations (no behavior change)
- Validate ColumnarEngine encode/decode for numeric types to leverage compression and SIMD paths; add benches with realistic datasets when mature.
- Document partitioning + stats maintenance and ensure planner pruning.

Evidence
- KV scan artifacts under `benchmark_results/<date>/`.
