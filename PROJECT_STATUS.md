# Lightning DB Project Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Core Database
- B+Tree storage engine with insert, get, delete, range scans
- LSM tree for write optimization
- MVCC transaction support
- WAL (Write-Ahead Log) with group commit
- ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache) implementation
- Memory pool with configurable policies
- Secondary indexes with B+Tree implementation
- Query planner with automatic index selection
- Join operations (inner, left, right, full outer)

### Performance Features
- AutoBatcher for write batching (achieved 248K ops/sec previously)
- SyncWriteBatcher for synchronous batching
- Lock-free data structures for optimization
- SIMD operations for checksums and comparisons
- Zero-copy serialization
- Prefetching and cache warming
- Adaptive compression (Zstd, LZ4, Snappy)

### Advanced Features
- Async I/O implementation with tokio
- Master-slave replication
- Horizontal sharding (hash and range based)
- Online backup with I/O throttling
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
- Incremental backups with parallel copying
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Real-time performance statistics
- Performance profiling tools

## üîß Current Issues

### Performance
1. **Write Performance**: Individual puts are slow (~800 ops/sec vs 100K+ target)
   - WAL group commit adds latency (10ms intervals)
   - Transaction overhead for every put
   - Sleep loops instead of condition variables

2. **AutoBatcher Inconsistency**: Performance varies (6K-28K ops/sec)
   - Should achieve 100K+ ops/sec
   - Previous benchmark showed 248K ops/sec

3. **Default Configuration**: Not optimized for performance
   - Defaults to Sync WAL mode (slow)
   - No automatic write batching

### Testing
- Some tests hang or take very long
- Integration tests timeout frequently
- Examples run slowly due to performance issues

## üìä Performance Summary

| Operation | Current | Target | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Write (sync) | 400 ops/sec | 100K+ | ‚ùå |
| Write (async) | 800 ops/sec | 100K+ | ‚ùå |
| Write (AutoBatcher) | 28K ops/sec | 100K+ | ‚ùå |
| Read (cached) | 10M ops/sec | 1M+ | ‚úÖ |
| Binary size | ~5MB | <5MB | ‚úÖ |

## üöÄ Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Always use AutoBatcher** for write operations
2. **Use Async WAL mode** for better performance
3. **Disable compression** if using pure B+Tree
4. **Use batch operations** when possible

### For Further Development
1. **Fix WAL latency**: Replace sleep loops with condition variables
2. **Add fast path**: Non-transactional puts for simple operations
3. **Default optimizations**: Better default configuration
4. **Async improvements**: True async WAL writes
5. **Documentation**: Performance tuning guide

## üèÜ Achievements
- Exceeded read performance target (10M vs 1M ops/sec)
- Implemented all major database features
- Added advanced features (replication, sharding, PITR)
- Clean architecture with modular design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Memory safe implementation

## üìù Notes
- The database is feature-complete but needs performance tuning
- Read performance is excellent, write performance needs work
- All advanced features are implemented (compression, replication, etc.)
- Code compiles without warnings
- Binary size target achieved
