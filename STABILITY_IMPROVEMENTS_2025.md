## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. Panic Points in Production Code

#### High Priority Fixes

1. **Admin Server Port Parsing** (`src/bin/lightning-admin-server.rs`)
   - **Issue**: Uses `.expect()` which panics on invalid port numbers
   - **Impact**: Admin server crashes on invalid user input
   - **Fix**: Replace with proper error handling

2. **Time-Related Unwraps** (Multiple locations)
   - **Issue**: `SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap()`
   - **Impact**: Could panic if system time is before UNIX epoch
   - **Fix**: Use `.unwrap_or_else()` with fallback

3. **FileGuard Methods** (`src/utils/resource_guard.rs`)
   - **Issue**: `.expect("File already closed")` 
   - **Impact**: Panics if file accessed after closure
   - **Fix**: Return `Option<&File>` instead

### 2. Memory Safety Issues

#### Unsafe Code Requiring Attention

1. **SIMD Operations Without Bounds Checking**
   ```rust
   // batch_ops.rs
   let chunk = *(k.as_ptr().add(offset) as *const u64);
   ```
   - **Risk**: Buffer overflow if offset + 8 > k.len()
   - **Fix**: Add explicit bounds checking before pointer arithmetic

2. **Memory-Mapped File Operations**
   - **Risk**: External file truncation causes segfault
   - **Fix**: Validate region size and add protective checks

3. **Lock-Free Data Structures**
   - **Risk**: Use-after-free in concurrent scenarios
   - **Fix**: Strengthen epoch-based reclamation

4. **Static Lifetime Extension**
   - **Risk**: Use-after-free if PROFILER modified
   - **Fix**: Use proper synchronization primitives

### 3. Concurrency Safety

#### Areas Needing Review

1. **Lock-Free Cache** (`src/lock_free/cache.rs`)
   - Potential ABA problems in compare-and-swap operations
   - Memory ordering may be insufficient

2. **Transaction Manager** (`src/transaction/mvcc.rs`)
   - Complex lock acquisition patterns risk deadlock
   - Version cleanup may race with active transactions

3. **Background Compaction** (`src/lsm/background_compaction.rs`)
   - File deletion races with ongoing reads
   - SSTable reference counting needs verification
